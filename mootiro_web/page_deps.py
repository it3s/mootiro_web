The problem: script and CSS linking in HTML, using various templates
====================================================================

If you develop web applications, you may have found yourself wondering how
to stop worrying about which stylesheets and javascript libraries
you should import in a given page, especially when that page is a composition
of fragments defined in various templates or functions.

There are 2 sides to this problem.
Worst of all is not declaring a library that is needed, 'cause then your
page does not work. But almost as bad is declaring everything you
might ever need in your master template -- because then, pages that don't need
heavy javascript libraries will be unnecessarily heavy and slow.

A solution is needed that allows you to first declare what you use, then on
each specific page, or even page fragment, declare what you need right there,
and the solution would generate the HTML imports, without repeating them.

We also must keep in mind that the order matters. For instance, jquery.ui
depends on jquery; and CSS has inheritance, so we need to link stylesheets
in the correct order.

The solution: PageDeps
======================

The following couple of classes are an attempt to solve that problem.
First of all, while you configure the application, you declare the files
that might be imported:

    deps_registry = DepsRegistry()
    deps_registry.lib('jquery', "/static/scripts/jquery-1.4.2.min.js")
    deps_registry.lib('deform', "/static/scripts/deform.js", depends='jquery')

The first argument to lib() -- and in fact to the other methods, too --
is a simple name for you to refer to the item later on.

As you can see, we can declare that deform.js depends on jquery. For more than
one dependency, you may use a list or a pipe:  depends="jquery|jquery.ui"

We also have a concept of a bottom_js: a javascript file that should be
declared at the bottom of the page, not at the top -- usually not a library,
but something "ad hoc" that might use libraries but might execute immediately,
relying on some HTML code. For instance:

    deps_registry.bottom_js('adhoctable',
                       "/static/scripts/add_features_to_a_certain_table.js",
                       depends='jquery')

What about CSS? Maybe there the declaration order will be enough?

    deps_registry.css('deform1', "/deform/css/form.css")
    deps_registry.css('deform2', "/deform/css/theme.css")

Actually, if you use, for example, the Deform library, you need to import
javascript files as well as CSS files, so we have a notion of a package:

    deps_registry.package('deform', css='deform1|deform2',
                          libs='deform', bottom_js=None)

OK, that is all for the registry, done at initialization time.

Now, for each new request, make sure your web framework instantiates
a PageDeps, passing it the deps_registry, and make it available to
controllers and templates. For instance, in the Pyramid web framework:

    @subscriber(interfaces.INewRequest)
    def on_new_request(event):
        event.request.page_deps = PageDeps(deps_registry)

After that, controller and view code can easily access the PageDeps instance
and do this kind of thing:

    # Use just one library:
    request.page_deps.lib('jquery')
    # Use a couple of stylesheets:
    request.page_deps.css('deform1')
    # Use just one bottom javascript file:

    # Or maybe import several stylesheets and javascript libraries:
    request.page_deps.package('deform')

Finally, to get the HTML output, you just include this inside the <head>
element of your master template:

    ${literal(request.page_deps.render_head())}

...and this at the bottom of the master template, for eventual javascript:

    ${literal(request.page_deps.render_bottom())}

I asked on IRC what other developers thought about this idea, you can read it
at __feedback__.

<nandoflorestan> Does anyone know any code for creating a kind of registry for CSS imports and/or JavaScript imports, and dynamically dealing with their dependencies?
<benbangert> nandoflorestan: not offhand, toscawidgets has some stuff to try and track repeat CSS/JS includes and such
<nandoflorestan> http://code.google.com/p/bag/source/browse/bag/web/html_imports.py

<benbangert> nandoflorestan: I guess the reason I shy away from that is its inefficient to have a bunch of CSS/JS links on a page
<benbangert> I usually put all the JS required for the entire site together in one file, minimize the crap out of it, and serve it once with a super long expires
<benbangert> same with CSS
<mgedmin> it would be shiny to have the framework do that for me
<mgedmin> bunch of .js and .css files in my source tree --> automatic collection + minification + caching of minified version on disk + serving with long expiration date and hash/timestamp in url
<rmarianski> some guys worked on some middleware at some point in the past to do that
<rmarianski> http://svn.repoze.org/repoze.squeeze/trunk/
<rmarianski> i'm not sure what the status of that is currently though
<rmarianski> looks like malthe did most of it
<RaFromBRC> :)
<blaflamme> marianski, that middleware looks good

<benbangert> but I know for many uses that just doesn't work
<benbangert> so I definitely see the utility of something like that
<RaFromBRC> nandoflorestan: yeah, i think it looks useful... i've used similar tools in other systems
<gjhiggins> nandoflorestan: headbottom would be useful
<ScottA> nandoflorestan: That looks very useful. Having registry.head_bottom would be semantically nice
<ScottA> Or something to that effect
<nandoflorestan> Why is head_bottom useful if we have dependency checking?
<gjhiggins> nandoflorestan: less work for the dev
<nandoflorestan> just tell me how so, just so I know we are on the same page here
<ScottA> Pure semantics. There's some javascript stuff I like to stick in the head that isn't library code. jQuery(document).ready(), data structures, that sort of thing
<nandoflorestan> ScottA, thanks, I understand it better after what you said.
<nandoflorestan> oh wait, what about javascript literals (not external files)
<nandoflorestan> I guess those are out of the scope huh
<ScottA> Probably
<ScottA> You could accept python data structures and convert then to JSON, maybe
<ScottA> Might be useful for people who like to use dynamic javascript
